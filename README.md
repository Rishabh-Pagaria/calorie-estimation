# calorie-estimation
This project implements a novel multi-modal deep learning approach for estimating lunch calorie intake. The model integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for processing food images and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for analyzing Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) data.
